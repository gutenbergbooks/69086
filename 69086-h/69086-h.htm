</div>


<p>The national conference of charities
and correction was held in Boston from
June 7 to June 14. The committee on
lawbreakers had the opening session, on
Wednesday. Three section meetings
were held by the committee during conference
week.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Review</span> prints in this issue many
of the papers prepared for the sessions
of the “lawbreakers,” as they were facetiously
called. Other papers will be
printed next month. This is a small
monthly, and some papers have been
crowded out.</p>

<p>The keynotes of the “lawbreakers”
sections were: (1) Need for the abolition
of local and county jails as prisons
for convicted offenders and the
establishment in their places of state district
workhouses or houses of correction;
(2) full and impartial consideration
by the national conference of the
problem of prison labor; (3) more rational
and adequate treatment of the
mentally defective delinquent; (4) the
imperative need of a change in our treatment
of misdemeanants, especially vagrants,
inebriates and offenders under the
age of 21; (5) the necessity of standardizing
the methodology of probation
work; (6) the need of far greater organization
of parole work; (7) the necessity
of developing crime statistics and
statistics regarding offenders so that
records may be of real value.</p>

<p>Many other notes were struck. The
spirit of the sessions was optimistic, but
questions and comments were frank and
searching.</p>

<p>The committee on lawbreakers has a
very definite place on the program, even
though, as this year, the name of the
committee may be changed, the committee
for 1912 being called “committee on
courts and prisons.”</p>

<p>During the conference strong sentiment
was developed in accord with the
recommendation of the committee on
lawbreakers that prison labor be made
an important part of the program of the
conference for 1912. It was stated by
members of the committee on organization
of the conference that the matter
was thoroughly discussed in the committee,
and that the understanding was that
the title of the committee for 1912 admits
of the introduction of this subject
at the next national conference. It remains
now for the members of the committee
on courts and prisons to see that
this subject is placed on the program.</p>

<p>The conference as a whole was characterized
by the excellence of the papers,
the fundamental nature of the topics discussed,
the high-water mark in attendance
reached, and the hospitality of Boston’s
representatives at the conference.
Year by year the conference departs
more from the technical discussion of
institutions and methods, concerning itself
increasingly with the problem of the
general improvement of social conditions.
The next conference will be held
in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1912.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">National Conference of Charities and Correction, O. F. Lewis, General Secretary of New York Prison
Association, Chairman.</p>


<p>The Committee on Lawbreakers presents
to the National Conference of
Charities and Correction a partial survey
of needs not yet met in the field of
the treatment of the delinquent. In
October, 1910, the eighth international
prison congress met for the first time on
American soil. Never before had this
country been under so comprehensive or
so discriminating a scrutiny by foreign
criminologists. As one newspaper man
put it: “The world’s spot-light was
turned on American prisons and American
treatment of prisoners.”</p>

<p>In April, 1911, Sir Evelyn Ruggles-Brise,
the Chairman of the English prison
commission, and president-elect of the
next international prison congress of
1915, reported to his government. He
commended in general American state
prisons and reformatories, but condemned
the systems, or lack of systems, in
vogue in city and county jails. “Among
the jails,” he stated, “many features linger
such as called forth the wrath of
John Howard, the great English philanthropist,
noted for his exertions on behalf
of prison reform at the end of the
18th century. Promiscuity, unsanitary
conditions, absence of supervision, idleness
and corruption—these remain features
in many places,” says the report.
“Until the abuses of the jail system are
removed, it is impossible,” concludes Sir
Evelyn, “for the United States to have
assigned to her by general consent a
place in the vanguard of <i>la science penitentiaire</i>.”</p>

<p>This is not pleasant reading, yet the
question with us tonight is not whether
this criticism makes us as Americans
pride-sore, but as to the truth of this
friendly but stinging criticism. On our
program this evening we have a distinguished
gentleman, son of the eminent
American founder of the international
prison congress, who will testify that
the English comments of Sir Evelyn are
mild as compared with the American
reality.</p>

<p>Rome was not built in a day. As in Chicago
you find still in immediate context
the mansion and the hovel, we have, in
our treatment of delinquents, in close
juxtaposition the prison and the jail,
the reformatory and the workhouse,
children’s courts and lynch law, probation
and short term sentences, the
indeterminate sentence and industrial
prison idleness, parole and definite sentences,
prison hospitals for tuberculosis
and jail pens for syphilis-infected
tramps. Civic pride in great modern
prisons exists side by side with civic
indifference as to filthy lock-ups or town
jails.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the second decade
of the twentieth century—the century of
hoped-for social justice—let us face
frankly certain problems yet unsolved
in the treatment of delinquents. Far
from feeling that we have reached the
thumb-twiddling stage of complacent
satisfaction, let us see where our methods
still break down.</p>

<p>First, <i>the local and county jails</i>. Not
stopping with the remark of Thomas
Holmes at the international prison congress
that “every jail I saw on the
American trip ought to be wiped off the
face of the earth,” and that nowhere in
Europe do such conditions exist, we find
Professor Charles R. Henderson as
chairman of a special committee of the
American Prison Association of Chicago
in 1907, uttering a scathing arraignment
of revolting and demoralizing jail conditions.
We find Frederick H. Wines
more recently in Maryland arraigning
jail conditions in many parts of the country.
We find Warren F. Spalding of
Massachusetts writing in the Sage
Foundation volumes on Correction and
Prevention about the jail friendships
that make of the novice a life long criminal,
of the contamination of women
prisoners, the herding of juvenile offenders
with adults, the dearth of attention
to physical conditions in jails, the
deplorable lack of proper ventilation, the
ravages of disease among jail inmates
and the absence of that rigid vigilance
without which the ordinary jail cannot
be kept in a sanitary condition; overcrowding,
night buckets, monotony, filth,
poorly cooked or tainted food, unconvicted
prisoners and convicted prisoners
in unrestricted communication, the fee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
system, local inattention to the fundamental
principles of penology.</p>

<p>The case against the average jail
seems proved. Has not the time come
to make a general national campaign
against this “school of crime?”</p>

<p>Mr. F. G. Pettigrove of Massachusetts
dissents from the above statements regarding
jails as follows:</p>

<p>“I do not approve the unqualified general
denunciation of jails. Nobody who
is familiar with the Massachusetts jails
would make such an attack upon them
as is implied by the form of the reference
to that subject.”</p>

<p><i>Prison Labor.</i> Prison labor is an unsettled
problem; one that we must face;
a problem complicated by local and state
conditions, and one in which the motives
of men and even communities have often
been impugned. Scanning the titles of
papers read at the national conference
of charities and correction during the
last decade, we have found only in the
committee report by Mr. Whittaker in
1908 and in the paper of Dr. James H.
Leonard, Superintendent of the Ohio
State Reformatory, definite and extended
treatment of the prison labor
problem, this fundamental problem of
penology.</p>

<p>Has the problem been solved? Are
prisoners everywhere earning their maintenance?
Has any one system proved
satisfactory? Is there general consensus
of opinion that the prisoner shall not
be utilized for private gain? Is there
no demoralizing idleness in so-called
model prisons? Is there no high tension
labor in so-called model prisons?</p>

<p>No, prison labor has not reached a
satisfactory solution when we can still
cite a recent article of Dr. A. J. McKelway
in Volume II. of “Correction and
Prevention” regarding prison labor in
the South: “The leasing of convicts
whether to corporations or individuals,
is a system that has been abolished by
some of the southern states, but which
still prevails in some of the states, accompanied
as it always has been with
indefensible abuses (p. 72). I make bold
to affirm that such abuses as were found
to exist in Georgia will be found to exist
in a greater or less degree in every state
where the leasing system still prevails.”</p>

<p>We learn that in Alabama even the
wardens and the guards are employed by
the contractors. We find that in Ohio
in connection with the discontinuance
of contract labor and the development
of the State use system the state penitentiary
was plunged into the most deplorable
idleness. We find in Pennsylvania
an archaic legal compulsion to
utilize only hand power machinery, and
but thirty-five per cent of the prisoners
at any one time. We find under the
present status of the state use system in
New York that the State prisoners earn
only about one-fourth of the cost of
their maintenance, and a nominal sum
of not more than 2c. a day, which earnings
can be radically reduced by fines.
We find loud protests in Rhode Island
because the State lets the services of able
bodied prisoners to contractors at 30c.
a day, and we find in Maryland under
the contract system a penitentiary which
is said to have returned to the State
treasury in 1910 a surplus of thirty-five
thousand dollars from the earnings of
prisoners, while the over time work
earned for the prisoners themselves
$41,928. We find the Detroit House of
Correction on the State account system
earning a profit in 11 years of $368,000,
paying its prisoners from ten to twenty-five
cents a day wages, and planning to
distribute to the families of prisoners,
through the city poor master, $15,000
during the year 1911 in addition to the
surplus which it expects to turn over to
the city. We find the Minnesota State
prison under the State account system
making the following report for the last
ten years:</p>

<table class="autotable">
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Total earnings</td>
<td class="tdr">$2,210,880</td>

<td class="tdl">Total expenses</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Excess of earnings</td>
<td class="tdr">$1,011,632</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The binder twine plan in the ten years
has made a profit of $1,653,290, of which
$352,553 was paid to the support fund
for convict labor. Quoting again from
Dr. McKelway, we learn that in Texas
the convicts are worked on the leasing,
contract, public account and public works
system. “But a legislative investigating
committee has recently discovered horrible
abuses in all these systems. A
number of convicts were found who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
been literally beaten to death during the
last year (1909) and the prisoners
seemed to dread the prison farm as much
as work within the prison wall, if not
more.”</p>

<p>We find Warden Gilmour of the
Toronto Central prison stating that on
the prison farm of that institution the
inmates work cheerfully and without
guards. And so, ladies and gentlemen,
your Committee on Lawbreakers respectfully
suggests that the general subject
of prison labor, in its various phases,
be made the chief subject of this committee
at the next national conference.
Prison labor is not simply an administrative
problem; it is an industrial problem
and a health problem, and concerns
vitally the training and efficiency of
scores of thousands who, leaving prison,
are potential subjects for charity of a
public or private nature. It is a vital
problem for the national conference of
charities and correction as well as for
the American prison association. The
problem of the proper utilization of
prisoners is a fundamental problem in
every American state.</p>

<p>The fact that a separate organization,
the National Committee on Prison
Labor, has been established to study the
prison labor problem, and the further
fact that the newspaper and magazine
press has manifested much interest in
the field which this committee occupies,
are evidences of the extent and importance
of the field.</p>

<p>Frank L. Randall, General Superintendent
of the Minnesota State Reformatory
and a member of the Committee
on Lawbreakers, makes the following
suggestion:</p>

<p>“If the recommendation of the Committee
on Lawbreakers be adopted to
make the subject of prison labor a feature
of the next conference the leaders
of organized labor should be invited to
participate. We should ask the labor representatives,
if they urge the state use
plan, to concede to the prisons the field,
so far as the products are paid for with
public funds.”</p>

<p><i>The Treatment of Defective Delinquents.</i> There are undoubtedly thousands of
feeble-minded persons in correctional institutions.
In recent annual reports, of
Elmira Reformatory, it has been stated
that about 35% of its inmates are mentally
defective. The presence of the
feeble-minded is a detriment to many
plans that have been adopted for the
instruction and training of prisoners.
The complete exclusion from the ordinary
prison of persons afflicted with tuberculosis
has improved the healthfulness
of those prisons and has also supplied a
better and more hopeful means of treatment
for the unfortunate sufferers. The
same treatment—segregation—should be
applied to all those to whom special
treatment would be a benefit, or whose
ailments are of such a nature as to endanger
the welfare of others. Dr. Henry
E. Goddard of Vineland estimates that
25% of delinquents are mentally defective.
“All mental defectives would be
delinquents,” he states, “in the very nature
of the case, did not some one exercise
some care over them. The mentally
defective must be cared for as we care
for irresponsibles.” Mr. Ernest K.
Coulter, for many years clerk of the
Children’s Court of Manhattan and
Bronx, New York City, states his belief
that the most important step to be
taken by the state in its slow abandonment
of antiquated methods of dealing
with child offenders and victims of bad
environment and neglect must be the
establishment of institutions for the special
treatment of the mental defectives
of this class. In the great state of New
York, there is no special custodial institution
to which the criminal feeble-minded
can be committed and transferred. So
important is this matter, that it has been
made the subject of one of the section
meetings of this Committee on Lawbreakers.</p>

<p><i>Parole.</i> The principle of parole is a
fundamental complement to the principle
of the indeterminate sentence. Its
successful application requires an efficient
merit system within the prison, a
competent parole board and adequate
supervision of the post-prison parole period,
the co-operation of the employment
giving public, and the persistent following
up, recapture and reimprisonment of
wilful violators of parole.</p>

<p>Only in a most general way do we yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
know the results of the administration of
parole systems in the country. We find
a general belief based on long experience
and some careful study of prison
statistics, that about 75% of paroled
persons from reformatories or prisons
“stay straight” during the parole period.
We still lack any study of sufficient magnitude
to admit of generalization in the
case of any state as to the proportion
of criminal recidivism <i>after</i> the parole
period. The New York Prison Association
will shortly make public an extended
study of the careers of seven
hundred inmates of Elmira Reformatory,
yet this number, though intensively
studied, will be too small for any
comprehensive generalization but will
rather indicate both a statistical method
of study of criminal careers and the
great inadequacy of present institutional
or extra-institutional social facts and
social statistics of delinquents.</p>

<p>As regards post-prison treatment and
aid of the released or discharged prisoner,
we find Amos W. Butler in Volume
II of the Sage Foundation series
on “Correction and Prevention” reporting
that only about 24 organizations exist
throughout this country for this purpose,
though several of these societies
spread their activity through a number
of states. We find also very varying
periods of parole, some of six months
as at Elmira, some of seven months, as
at Huntington, Pa.; nine months, as at
the Illinois State Reformatory, or until
the expiration of the maximum sentence,
as at Concord, Mass., or at Bedford,
or Albion in New York. We find
in Mr. Butler’s study state after state
recorded as follows: “State makes no
effort to find work or keep in touch with
prisoner after his discharge;” “no provision
for aftercare of either paroled or
discharged prisoners;” “no parole officers;”
“no parole agents;” “no provision
for finding work or for visiting
prisoners,” etc., etc.</p>

<p>A prominent eastern reformatory superintendent
recently said: “Why spend
nearly two hundred dollars annually to
maintain one inmate in a reformatory,
and then spend only $1.50 per inmate
during his period of parole to help him
not to go wrong?” This committee on
lawbreakers believes that the parole
period of an offender is barely second in
importance to the period of imprisonment.
The poorly supervised parole
period breeds recidivism, contempt for
law, the alienation of the sympathy of
judges, the irritation and criticism of
the public, unintelligent scorn for reformatory
methods, and immense ultimate
cost to the state in further loss of
property or life.</p>

<p><i>The Probation Movement</i>, long
known and developed in Massachusetts,
has during this last decade made great
national progress. Nevertheless the
probation movement faces grave dangers.
It is on the defensive. The methodology
of probation is still in the experimental
stage. More important than
the extension of the system is the building
up of an effective technique. In too
many places probation is still synonymous
either with sentimental leniency or with
perfunctory police surveillance. The
most essential factors in probation work
are the educative, reformatory and reconstructive
work represented by home
visitation, the development of right mental
habits and the rendering of practical
assistance.</p>

<p>The improvement of probation methods
depends primarily upon the appointment
of interested, faithful and
competent probation officers. The tendency
is strongly in the direction of increasing
the number of public salaried
probation officers. Although this tendency
is inevitable and desirable, it brings
in its trail the gravest danger of which
the probation system must meet, namely
the danger of appointments being made
through the influence of partisan politics.
Those interested in the probation
system should therefore look squarely
in the face the question as to how probation
officers should be appointed;
whether by judges without interference
by any outside regulations or authorities;
whether through civil service examination;
whether upon the approval
of some outside body such as a state
probation commission, or whether the
appointing power should be vested in
authorities other than the judges, as in
local non-partisan, non-sectarian committees
or commissions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>Ex-Attorney-General Julius M. Mayer
dissents from the foregoing paragraph
as follows:</p>

<p>“I am opposed to the appointing
power being placed in anybody except
the judges, which, to my mind, leaves
open only the question as to whether examinations
should be competitive or
non-competitive.”</p>

<p>In a further letter Judge Mayer
writes:</p>

<p>“There cannot be any discussion as to
who should appoint probation officers.
It is absurd to say that any person outside
of the judge should appoint. I personally
should refuse, if a judge, to
place anybody on probation if the probation
officers were appointed by any
one but the court or judge. As a matter
of fact I doubt seriously whether in
New York State there would be any
legal power in any other body to make
any such appointment. The suggestions,
in this regard, are, to my mind, utterly
absurd and unworthy of being dignified
by being incorporated in our report.”</p>

<p>A problem in administrative efficiency
that must be worked out is the co-ordination
of probation and parole systems.
There seem no valid reasons why in general
the same persons cannot do both
probation and parole work in the same
localities. At present parole supervision
is usually exercised by persons who are
not probation officers and often the parole
officers are itinerant officers obliged
to travel over wide areas. The effective
supervision and aid of those on parole
requires that those exercising the parole
oversight shall confine their efforts to
a comparatively limited area. The efficiency
of parole service would undoubtedly
be greatly strengthened in communities
where it is not practicable to have
special parole officers, if the parole work
were entrusted to the local probation officers.
This combination of work, if
properly carried on, can be carried on
with mutual advantage to both systems
and without any detriment to either of
them.</p>

<p><i>The Wives and Children of Prisoners.</i>
The dependency of these often innocent
victims of the delinquency of the breadwinner
is closely allied to the problem of
prison labor. Any plan is paradoxical
that removes a breadwinner to prison
idleness and leaves a despairing family
to exist by charitable help or by the
bounty of impoverished neighbors. The
state having the right to protect itself
from crime by imprisoning the offender,
has also the duty to make work for him,
first to pay for his own maintenance,
and secondly, to contribute, so far as
possible, to the maintenance of his family.
No explanations of alleged necessary
idleness, of lack of orders for
prison goods, of political interference
with extension of prison labor systems,
or of the need of the payment of prisoners’
earnings to a tax-ridden state should
prevail against the fact that the state or
the political subdivision of a state owes
to the stricken family the partial fruits
of the toil of the prisoner and <i>must</i> develop
such a system of industry as will
both make the prisoner self supporting
and bring to his family some return for
his labor. Inability to accomplish less
than this is a confession of state-inefficiency
that should not be tolerated and
that invites the fullest scrutiny.</p>

<p><i>Farm Colonies.</i> The campaign for
compulsory farm colonies for habitual
tramps and vagrants has gained much
impetus since 1907, when the problems
of vagrancy were discussed in detail, at
the Minneapolis national conference of
charities and correction. In a half
dozen states farm colony bills were introduced
last winter, but none were
passed. The press seems almost unanimous
in favor of such colonies; public
opinion is expressing even greater annoyance
at the so-called “tramp-army.”
Typical of the dissatisfaction with the
present expensive and palliative treatment
of vagrancy is the reiterated statement
of the New York State Board of
Charities that vagrancy costs the state
of New York about two million dollars
a year from public and private charitable
funds.</p>

<p>The time certainty seems at hand for
a systematic campaign against the vagrancy
evil. Drifting methods of alleviation
and of passing-on constitute only
an aggravation of the situation. Vagrancy
and crime are closely akin. The
Committee on Lawbreakers raises the
question whether the movement partially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
organized several years ago for a national
vagrancy committee should not at
this session of the national conference
be organized with the aim of furthering
systematic methods for the reduction of
vagrancy. A problem in European
countries sufficiently serious to be called
one of the most fundamental social
problems deserves systematic and adequate
attention in the United States
where the problem is still in its earlier
stages.</p>

<p>Closely allied is the great problem of
inebriety and its treatment. The special
United States census of 1904 showed
that 54% of all commitments to correctional
institutions were due to intoxication,
vagrancy and disorderly conduct.
A special committee of this national conference
of 1911 treats of this national
question in a general session and in section
meetings. The committee on lawbreakers
emphasizes the pressing immediate
need of state and national campaigns
for the reduction of drunkenness
and the rational treatment of the drunkard.</p>

<p><i>Prisoners’ Aid Societies.</i> Organized
charitable work of private societies in
the correctional field is woefully slight
in comparison with the charity organization
movement for the spread of the
gospel of social service. There are
hardly a score of active prisoners’ aid
societies of fairly wide range in the
United States. Yet the great movement
for probation and parole, for better
prisons and for better prisoners, for the
help of released prisoners and for dependent
families of prisoners, for the
reduction of vagrancy and inebriety, for
the better care of the mentally or physically
defective delinquents, for better
laws and greater public information—these
great movements need the directing
power of strong charitable organizations
of the prisoners’ aid kind. The
field of delinquency needs the same
thorough development that in the last
generation has been accorded to the
field of charity. A national prisoners’
aid society was organized at the last
meeting of the American Prison Association,
to develop greater co-operation
between the now existing prisoners’ aid
societies and to extend the prisoners’ aid
work. The national association publishes
a monthly journal of sixteen pages
called the Review.</p>

<p><i>American Criminology.</i> Tendencies
in this country in the problems of the
treatment of the criminal have been
overwhelmingly administrative rather
than analytical and academic. Our foreign
guests in 1910 often remarked that
we characteristically experimented and
did things rather than debated and philosophized
on the theories of criminology.
The extravagance of sole adhesion
to the former method is increasingly obvious,
however, and has led, among
other things, to the organization of the
American Institute of Criminal Law
and Criminology, a central body for the
inculcation of more scientific methods
for the treatment of the delinquent as
well as for the extension of our knowledge
of the criminal. A recent conference
in New York City on the reform
of the criminal law and procedure indicated
the wide-spread belief of the ablest
members of the bench and bar that
our criminal law and its administration
need radical reforms. In the fields of
criminal statistics, also, we need far
more light even if such light shall only
indicate clearly that comprehensive and
accurate criminal statistics are practically
impossible to collate. To the efforts
of the American Institute of Criminal
Law and Criminology to advance in
accuracy, in dignity, and in usefulness
our store of information as to crime and
its treatment, the national conference
should give full credit and strong encouragement.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_SUPPRESSION_OF_MORAL_DEFECTIVES">THE SUPPRESSION OF MORAL DEFECTIVES</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">Abstract of Address of Charles W. Eliot, President Emeritus of Harvard University</p>


<p>The prevention of crime through the
isolation or extirpation of criminals offers
many analogies to the prevention of
disease by the isolation or death of diseased
persons. These analogies are obvious,
and are based on observed facts
and not on any theory that all moral
defects originate in, or are caused by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
physical defects. Opinions might differ
widely concerning the bodily origin of
drunkenness, inordinate sexual passion,
or kleptomania; and yet persons holding
different views on this point might agree
as to the wisest treatment in practice of
such moral delinquents. Let us compare
society’s treatment of moral defectives
with its best treatment of physical defectives.
In the first place, a large proportion
of the crimes committed in our
country are not treated socially at all,
the criminals escaping detection and arrest,
or being acquitted when brought to
trial through the ingenious use of legal
technicalities and delays. This is as if
victims of scarlet fever or smallpox
should be left quite free to move about
in the community so far as their condition
permitted, society manifesting no
active interest in their welfare and taking
no precautions whatever against the
spread of their disease.</p>

<p>Secondly, in cases in which criminals
are arrested and convicted the penalties
imposed by courts have, as a rule, no
remedial and no preventive effect. Drunkards,
for example, brought frequently
before courts for sentence, are sent over
and over again to jails or houses of correction
for terms too short for effectual
cure, so that they soon relapse into
drunkenness when discharged. Or again,
a burglar is sentenced to a few years in
prison, acquires while confined no better
disposition and no new means of earning
a livelihood, and so when freed naturally
returns to his former criminal mode
of life.</p>

<p>Thirdly, many researches into the
history of criminal families have made
it sure that the propensity to crime, be
it moral, or physical, or both, is eminently
transmissible; so that criminals,
like imbeciles and other physical defectives,
will surely breed their like, if
left free to do so. To leave them free
is to perpetuate and multiply by inheritance
the evils and losses which
criminality inflicts on the race. These
comparisons suggest strongly that society
needs to revise its methods of
dealing with criminals. In this revision,
what improvements should be aimed at?
Better police protection, especially in
the detective department, so that fewer
crimes should be committed with impunity.
This would correspond with the
improving registration and responsible
social treatment of diseases.</p>

<p>A lessened use of fines and an increased
use of imprisonment for convicted
criminals of all sorts, a fine being
an almost useless penalty for crimes
against the person, since it has no improving
or instructive quality whatever,
is for the well-to-do a matter of indifference
and is often impossible to collect
from the poor. The habitual use of
longer terms of imprisonment, that is,
terms of isolation and temporary exemption
from temptation to crime. The
conversion of houses of correction, jails
and prisons into places of instruction
and of instructive labor, with incidental
confinement, from being places of confinement
with incidental labor, which is
often uninstructive or impossible of
utilization by the individual on his return
to the outer world. Through this
transformation houses of correction and
prisons would become agricultural or industrial
colonies, in which most prisoners
would acquire the habit of productive
labor and some skill available towards
livelihood when they should again enjoy
freedom.</p>

<p>Every person, male or female, who
has been convicted of crime, should be
registered at many points with complete
means of identification, and should be
kept under supervision for a long period
after discharge; and the new laws needed
to secure such continuous supervision,
if any, should be promptly adopted in
all the States. With such systematic supervision
should go assistance in the
giving of employment.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_ABOLITION_OF_THE_JAIL">THE ABOLITION OF THE JAIL</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">Synopsis of Address by Frederick H. Wines, Statistician, State Board of Administration, Illinois.</p>


<p>The average county or municipal jail
in this country is a school for crime, a
cesspool of moral contagion, a propagating
house of criminality, a feeder for
the penitentiary, a public nuisance and
a disgrace to modern civilization. The
public indifference to the situation is
attributed partly to ignorance. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
county officials do not know what a jail
should be and the people do not know
what their jails really are. In plain
Anglo-Saxon, the truth is that wherever
there exists local graft and political dishonesty
the county prison is its centre
and its stronghold. The sheriff or the
jailor makes a personal profit from crime
by charging a per diem for board for
prisoners and by the receipt of fees for
locking and unlocking the jail doors.
That profit is a live wire. No local politician,
possibly no member of the Legislature
or even of the State administration
dares monkey with it.</p>

<p>We have substantially won the fight
for the reformatory State prison and the
indeterminate sentence because we concentrated
our fire upon a vulnerable point
and made every shot tell. In attacking
the county jail system we have pursued
the opposite policy. We have addressed
our arguments and remonstrances to the
county authorities, of whom there are in
round numbers, 2,500 sets, instead of to
the legislative bodies, of which there are
less than fifty. We have pleaded for
new jails, better jails, when we should
have demanded their replacement by
prisons owned and controlled by the
State and their emancipation from local
political control with its petty and selfish
interests.</p>

<p>There was a time when local control
was necessary and proper but that was
long ago. Today the county prison is an
anachronism. We imported it with other
institutions from England, but conservative
England has outgrown it and
dates the dawn of its regenerate prison
system from the year of its abolition.
There is no good and sufficient reason
why the State which enacts a criminal
code with its definition of crime, its prohibitions
and its penalties should assume
the custody and care of the man committed
to prison for three years and refuse
to recognize its responsibility for
the man sentenced for three months,
abandoning him to the haphazard mercies
of the inferior jurisdiction which
is certainly ignorant, often brutal and
sometimes dishonest. It is not the majesty
of the county but that of the State
which calls for vindication. The supervision
of crime, let it take what form it
may, is the business of the State. The
State should name, and it should have
exclusive authority over the executive
agents to whom it entrusts the discharge
of this supreme governmental function.</p>

<p>The one hope of enlightened progress
in dealing with the problem of crime is
the overthrow of the county jail system.
To this end we must direct our energy.
With the State once in command, there
can be no question but it will find a way
to right the wrong and remedy the evils
which inhere in the present organization
and management of minor prisons.</p>

</div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Wm. Healy, M. D.</span></p>

<p class="center">Director, Juvenile Psychopathic Institute, Chicago</p>


<p>Reasons for the abundant ineffectiveness
in the treatment of the criminal are
to be found in the historical development
of the situation. His case is handled
by court procedure evolved, almost
wholly, from legal precedent and consisting
of rules which appertain, as it
were, to a definite contest. As the result
of this evolution it has come about
that even modern criminal procedure in
several respects fails to apply well established
scientific knowledge and so
lags far behind the dictates of common
sense.</p>

<p>It may be that the experiential wisdom
of the ages, crystallized into modern
law, serves well enough as the setting
for criminal trials in which there is
much presumption of innocence, as well
as for civil cases, although in this hour
of testing mental capacities even some
points here seem doubtful. But what
shall we say about the trial of recidivists,
those repeaters who make up the
costly and dangerous class, the confirmed
criminals? If there is anything
clear about the matter to the man in the
street it is that certain facts either purposely
avoided in court procedure, such
as inadmissible evidence, or not brought
out on account of incomplete examination
into the case are frequently most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
important for decision from the standpoint
of the welfare of society and indeed
often of the defendant’s own well-being.
The fact that the defendant has
been convicted of crime and perhaps of
this particular type of crime before, that
he has mental peculiarities or physical
infirmities that make him specially liable
to commit crime, that he comes from
a family in which mental deficiency is
inherited or the criminalistic tendency is
rampant—these points among others are
not only of scientific import, but seem
clearly germane and most valuable for
deciding what ought to be done with
him.</p>

<p>The facts of recidivism are startling
enough to command attention—whether
one’s interest in the matter be economic,
legal, humanitarian or anthropological.
The terrific cost of crime, the failure of
court methods to check criminalism,
either in the individual or as a whole,
the impotency of ordinary penological
efforts and the considerable inadequacy
of even the best reformatory type of institution
are causes for amazement. By
even a superficial glance at the facts we
are thrown at once into an inquiry,
what manner of a person is this recidivist,
this individual who in spite of admonitory
teachings and punishments
goes on pursuing a career which leads
him into just the situation which he
wishes to avoid. Justice Rhodes of
England writes an article in a medical
journal, putting up the matter squarely
to the medical profession, asking them
what it means when out of 182,000 convictions
in a year, 10,000 have been convicted
more than twenty times before.
“On the face of it,” he asks, “doesn’t
this seem more like a problem for those
who have to do with abnormal personalities
than merely for the law?”</p>

<p>Even if a statistical survey of crime
and recidivism did not point directly in
explanation to the peculiarities of the
unit offender, it would in general seem
as if the anthropological outlook, applied
to the criminal himself, would be easily
the best point of vantage in studying the
crime situation. Here is a given individual,
performing acts inimical to his
fellows and retributively painful to himself.
What leads him socially to react
thus and so? Taking this view, common
sense would seem to demand study
of the causative factors in every case,
and this means, first and foremost, investigation
of those mental characteristics
which underlie conduct.</p>

<p>Beginning such a study of the causative
factors of crime and taking account
of deviation from the normal among the
criminalistic, we immediately see that
mental defect looms very large. Just
how extensive this factor is we are unable
to say, because thoroughgoing examinations
of delinquents have not yet
been registered in sufficient numbers.
Sutherland, who has had a large experience
and has well considered the matter,
states in his work on Recidivism (p.
50) that it is not wide of the mark to
say that one-third of criminal recidivists
are pathological specimens, “suffering
from physical and mental degeneracy
characterized by mental warp, instability
and feeblemindedness,” and
that of petty offender recidivists it is
equally safe to hold that two-thirds are
pathological in the same sense. The
British Royal Commission for the study
of the feebleminded looked at 2,300
prisoners in cursory fashion and without
mental tests decided that they could
determine about ten per cent. to be
feebleminded. Incomplete work from
many sources testifies to considerable
proportions of feebleminded among
criminals. We ourselves, in our Chicago
Institute, are for several reasons doing
fairly intensive work, and I would at
once disclaim that our figures have
much statistical value. Yet of 620 cases
of youthful repeaters carefully studied
by us and classified in a scale of mental
ability and peculiarity, twenty-six per
cent. grade distinctly below the class
which we call poor in native ability.</p>

<p>We found:</p>

<table class="autotable2">
<tr>
<td>Mentally subnormal—a class above the ordinary institutional feebleminded types, but still well below the normal.</td>
<td class="tdr">51</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dull from physical causes, including epilepsy.</td>
<td class="tdr">36</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Feebleminded of the upper or moron group.</td>
<td class="tdr">48</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Feebleminded of the imbecile group.</td>
<td class="tdr">5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Psychoses (various types of mental disease).<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></td>
<td class="tdr borderbottom">22</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&#160;</td>
<td class="tdr">162</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Scattered for the most part through
these classes we found 7&#189; per cent. of
the total 620 to be definitely epileptic.</p>

<p>What a curious maladjustment it
seems that while all this acknowledged
social failure is in progress, and while
there is this obvious incompetency of
legal methods in ascertaining adequate
facts for betterment of the situation,
there should be so very little study of
where the trouble lies. In courts for
adult offenders there is almost no opportunity
for unbiassed investigation of the
individual criminal. In the juvenile
court, with its advantages of intimate
relationships established there, how can
the judge from his short examination
determine even this question of the mental
status of the delinquent? Opinion
on this subject in courts is formed by
the questionnaire method, which from
a scientific standpoint, for various reasons,
is notoriously unsafe. Not only in
court room procedure is there inadequate
investigation of the individual,
but all through the situation in regard
to the handling of delinquents the same
is true. Nowadays when the value of
efficiency bureaus is everywhere recognized,
it seems strange that this most
business-like bit of work should not
have been taken up. The outlay is
millions and hundreds of millions for
repression, but practically nothing for
the study of how efficiently to repress.</p>

<p>In the past the legal disposition of offenders
with mental peculiarity has very
largely hinged on the question of criminal
responsibility. Now this question,
especially in the case of high-grade mental
defectives, involves some pretty
fundamental philosophical points and
probably this most dangerous class will
never have its responsibility completely
standardized and determined. We have
in sight no likelihood of finding a test or
criterion of the power of ethical discernment
and control. The best thinkers
have finally relegated the whole
problem to the common sense of juries.
But a much more profitable way of
looking at the matter is whether or not
the individual is going to do it again,
whether he is going to become a recidivist,
a menace to society, and whether
he is to breed progeny of the same ilk.
The self-protection of society is herein
involved. Why should we not drop the
technical and hardly decidable question
of criminal responsibility and the idea
of mere punishment, and take up the
much more vital problem of how society
is to protect itself?</p>

<p>Looked at as a matter wherein the
welfare of society is the chief concern,
one most difficult point in the problem
of mental defect grows more readily soluble.
I speak of those cases in which
evidence of feeblemindedness, although
distinct, especially if studied by means
of tests, is minor in degree as compared
with the ethical defect present. These
form a class of offenders most difficult
to deal with because so frequently, on
account of good development of language
ability, they pass in the world in
general, and in courts in particular, as
practically normal individuals. This
type has been designated by various
terms. Anton has recently published a
symposium monograph on the subject
showing that the consensus of opinion
is that there certainly exists a distinct
group in which moral defect is out of
proportion to the amount of mental subnormality.
The recent report of the
Massachusetts commission on the increase
of criminals emphasizes this very
point. To those who doubt the existence
of mental defect in such cases I
commend the use of psychological tests.
Better study of the individual will,
in any case, give some indication of that
most important point for the welfare
of society, namely, whether or not the
crime will be repeated.</p>

<p>Turning in the interests of society to
the study of the individual offender, especially
the recidivist, we shall at once
be led by practical considerations into
an attempt to decipher the causative factors
of his career. The great value of
such intelligent study can be shown in
many types of cases, but nowhere is it
more evident than when the offenders
are mentally defective. The recent
work of Miss Moore for the Public Education
Association of New York shows
the after-records of some children formerly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
in the subnormal rooms in the
New York public schools and also of
some of the feebleminded men who
were paroled from the Elmira Reformatory
to New York. The financial and
moral cost to the community has been
very great from such sources. We ourselves
have many such records, showing
the terrible burden a criminalistic defective
is to the community. Dozens of
times, indeed up to a hundred times in
the police stations, is the record of even
some of the younger members of this
group, as we have observed them.</p>

<p>Intelligent study of the problem of
recidivism means catching the repeater
as early as possible and making a diagnosis
and prognosis for disposal of his
case at once or in the future. The advantages
of studying the recidivist when
young are many, both from a scientific
and a reformatory point of view. It is
often also of immense importance to
study the adult repeated offender. The
disposal of him offers more difficulties
frequently than the adjustment of the
juvenile case. There is one matter in
connection with adult offenders upon
which I wish to lay special emphasis. It
is in regard to the parole of criminals.
It seems clear to me that if the whole
matter of adult probation is to be placed
upon the most sensible basis, the scientific
facts which have bearing upon the
situation must be brought into use. I
hold that no criminal should be released
upon parole until enough of a study has
been made of his individuality and the
causative factors of his delinquency so
that there may be some sort of a guarantee
that his offenses will not be continued.
As it stands, almost nothing of
this sort is being done. It should be the
first and main inquiry of any board of
parole to know whether or not the individual
under consideration is likely to
be a recidivist. Several points of view
would be connected in such an inquiry,
but the point we are concerned with today
is one of the greatest value for the
decision. The first question to be asked,
if the matter is to be sensibly decided,
is about the mental status of the individual.
This inquiry with its various
ramifications will often be found of
great significance in answering the vital
question: “Will crime be committed
again by this individual?”</p>

<p>Intelligent study of an actual or a
potential recidivist means a fairly complete
investigation and is worth days of
work if this be necessary. It needs a
combination of the sociological, medical
and psychological standpoints. We ourselves
find particularly rich fields for
explanation of the case in getting the
history of families and of developmental
conditions and in psychological examinations.
The latter has been much hampered
in the past by lack of practical tests,
but of late these have been developed.
At the present time any intelligent observer
can judge something of the mental
capacity of an individual by seeing
his performance, under proper conditions,
on a group of tests which correspond
to the normal ability of the child.
The well-known Binet tests, imperfect
though they probably are in some respects,
form an epoch-making advance
in the study of feeblemindedness. We
ourselves have been at much pains in
the last two years in developing, with
the help of a number of psychologists,
a group of tests directed to the estimation
of native mental ability in older
and higher types of individuals. We
may hope for much greater standardization
of tests in the future, but, even as
it now stands, there can be no doubt that
just such a practical mental classification
as the work with delinquents demands
can be readily carried out by
qualified persons.</p>

<p>If, avoiding <i>a priori</i> standpoints, we
enter upon a study of the recidivist, we
find such a considerable number of causative
factors determinable that this at
once precludes the idea of crime being
anything like a disease entity. Indeed,
one soon comes to feel that many of the
set notions about crime are academic
and absurd in the light of facts ascertainable
by a free-minded, practical and
thoroughgoing investigation of the individual
cases. Crime may be the action
of a Charlotte Corday or of a Jesse
Pomeroy and in form, impulse and factors
of underlying causation may be
found to be so varied in its manifestations
that many pseudo-philosophical
speculations and legal pronunciamentos<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
on the subject are readily seen to be
nothing but slipshod generalizations.
Quinton, a man of great experience, in
his recent work says, with apparently
purposeful exaggeration, that there are
just as many classes as there are criminals.
Mental defect is to be considered
simply as one of the causes of crime, but
it is a cause so obvious, so readily determinable
in most cases and so certainly
irremediable and provocative of recidivism
and moral contagion that one
of the first steps of reform in dealing
with criminals ought to be directed toward
this. The mental defective is suitable
neither for probation, reformatory
education nor punitive measures. Custodial
care alone is of service and in the
case of the criminalistically inclined defective
the courts should directly commit
and the state protect itself by permanent
guardianship.</p>

<p>The time is ripe for better methods
of handling this class of cases. The
study of recidivism shows it as a blot
upon our civilization, and demonstrates
that many recidivists are mental defectives.
The study, on the other hand, of
the individual defective criminal demonstrates
him to be a source of great
financial loss and much moral contagion.
Studies in heredity prove that he
frequently begets his kind. Developments
along medical and psychological
lines have given us practical methods
for diagnosis of mental defectives—even
the border-line cases being easily
determinable as such—and give us assurance
of the social future of this class
of cases. The work of our own institute
proves not only the applicability of
common-sense study of causative factors
in general to court work in this
country, but directly demonstrates the
overwhelming value of early differentiation
of a type of offender, who by the
very nature of his mental make-up is
bound under ordinary social conditions
to become a recidivist.</p>

<p>In order to get a more business-like
administration of criminal affairs so
that there may be practical application
of at least some points which are scientifically
demonstrable as imperative for
the well-being of society, certain things
are necessary. Concerning our immediate
point, the needs are: first, better
education of everybody implicated in
the criminal situation as to the part that
mental defect plays in delinquency.
Then in connection with criminal courts,
and especially in connection with juvenile
courts, where the development of
crime can be checked, there should be
thoroughgoing study of the recidivist.
The court should be acquainted with the
practical value of such study and should
act on it. No offender should be allowed
on parole unless he is known to
have the mental make-up which, on the
whole, will in his environment tend to
prevent his freedom from being inimical
to society. Then, not a difficult matter
to insure, there must be better classified
institutional treatment. Finally,
the court should have the power to adjudicate
cases of mental defect in the
best interests of society.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="TREATMENT_OF_THE_MENTAL_DEFECTIVE_WHO">TREATMENT OF THE MENTAL DEFECTIVE WHO
IS ALSO DELINQUENT</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">DR. HENRY H. GODDARD, VINELAND, NEW JERSEY</p>


<p>Twenty-five per cent. of delinquents
are mentally defective. While we have
no absolute statistics, there are many indications
that this is a safe estimate.
All mental defectives would be delinquents
in the very nature of the case,
did not some one exercise some care
over them.</p>

<p>There is only one possible answer to
the question, “What is to be done with
the feebleminded person who is delinquent?”
He must be cared for, but he
must be cared for in a place where we
care for irresponsibles. The jail or
prison or reformatory, is not for him,
neither must he be turned loose on the
streets or sent back to the home and environment
in which he has already become
a delinquent.</p>

<p>In the present state of our laws and
customs, delinquency is the one means
by which we are able to get hold of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
certain type of mental defective and
provide for him as he should be provided
for. Many of these feebleminded
of the moron type come from homes or
have attained to such an age or position
that we have no way of getting hold of
them until they do some wrong and
come under the head of delinquents.
But when that has happened and we
have them where we can prescribe for
them, it is worse than folly for us to let
them go and turn them back into their
former environment where they must
only repeat the offense or even commit
a worse one.</p>

<p>We must have enough institutions or
colonies for the feebleminded to care
for all the feebleminded delinquents at
least. As it is today, even under the
best conditions, many a judge recognizes
mental defect in the cases that
come before him and would gladly send
the child to an institution for the feebleminded,
but there is no room, and so he
is compelled to utilize some makeshift
which oftentimes is worse than nothing
at all.</p>

<p>But the broadest treatment of this
topic must go farther back than the
question of what to do with these feebleminded
persons who have already become
delinquent. We must consider
the cause here as we are trying to do
everywhere in modern methods, and
treat the cause rather than trying to
cure. In other words, the feebleminded
person should be taken care of before
he becomes a delinquent. Here the first
problem is diagnosis. How shall we
recognize this feebleminded child of
high type, this moron grade, as we now
call them?</p>

<p>Until recently we have been more or
less helpless in this matter, but now we
may say with perfect assurance that the
Binet tests of intelligence are entirely
satisfactory and can be relied on to
pick out the mental defective at least up
to the age of twelve years. The public
schools will be the clearing house for all
these cases, they may there be tested and
their mental condition found out, and
they can then be cared for as condition
leads. We have too long attempted to
treat all children alike, whether in the
public school or before the courts.
When we have learned to discriminate
and recognize the ability of each child
and place upon him such burdens and
responsibilities only as he is able to bear,
then we shall have largely solved the
problem of delinquency.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PLACING_MISDEMEANANTS_ON_PROBATION">PLACING MISDEMEANANTS ON PROBATION</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">JAMES A. COLLINS</p>

<p class="center">Judge of the City Court, Indianapolis, Indiana</p>


<p>In the city campaign of 1909 I
pledged the people of the city of Indianapolis
that if elected judge of the
city court, I would introduce a probation
system as a means of helping delinquent
men and women. The enactment
of a law by the legislature of 1907,
under which courts may exercise the
right to suspend sentence or withhold
judgment in the cases of adults, made
possible the application of a probation
system in the administration of justice
in circuit, criminal and city courts.</p>

<p>The probation system inaugurated in
the city court of Indianapolis has covered:</p>


<h3><i>The Suspended Sentence.</i></h3>

<p>The power to suspend sentence has
saved many novices in crime from undergoing
the harsh punishment that
would be otherwise meted out to them,
and that seems to be contrary to the
constitutional provision that “all penalties
shall be proportioned according to
the nature of the offense.”</p>

<p>During the past year sentence has
been suspended in 236 cases and judgment
withheld in 3,474. The majority
of these were first offenders. In those
cases where the judgment was suspended,
the court has had to set aside
the suspension of sentence and commit
the defendants in only two cases, and
where the judgment has been withheld
less than two per cent. have been returned
to court for a second or subsequent
offense.</p>

<p>While there is no provision under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
law for the employment of paid probation
officers, adequate supervision in 352
cases was made possible by good citizens
volunteering to serve in that capacity.
These probationers were required
to furnish the court a monthly report
signed by the probation officer. Time
will not permit the details of these reports.
Each tells its own story of heroic
efforts toward right living.</p>


<h3><i>Paying Fines on Installments.</i></h3>

<p>The old method of collecting money
fines which compelled the defendant to
pay or replevy the same moment he was
fined was always a source of great hardship
on the poor. It was unreasonable
to expect a common laborer arrested late
at night and convicted in the morning to
be prepared to settle with the state. If
he was unable to pay or make arrangements
to have his fine stayed for the
statutory period, he was sent to prison,
not because the court had given him a
term of imprisonment, but because he
was poor, which is in effect, imprisonment
for debt.</p>

<p>To aid this particular class there was
introduced as a part of the probation
system a plan for the collection of fines
in small payments. In those cases
where the defendant appeared deserving
he has been released on his own recognizance
and the case held under advisement
for thirty to sixty days, as the circumstances
seemed to justify, at the expiration
of which time he was required
to report to the court that he had paid
in the amount designated as the fine and
costs to be entered against him.</p>

<p>At the close of the year 830 persons
had been given an opportunity to pay
their fines in this way. Of this number,
64 were re-arrested and committed for
their failure to pay their fine, and the affidavits
in 32 other cases are held for re-arrest.
The balance lived up to their
obligation with the court and paid in
more than $7,100.</p>

<p>This plan operates to the benefit of
the defendant in several ways: it saves
him his employment; it saves his family
from humiliation and disgrace, as well
as from the embarrassment incident to
imprisonment; but more than all, it
saves him his self-respect. With but a
single exception not one to whom this
opportunity has been given and who had
paid his fine in full has been in court a
second time.</p>


<h3><i>Drunkenness and the Pledge System.</i></h3>

<p>No unfortunates appeal more strongly
to the court than the victims of the
liquor habit. In all cases of first offenders
charged with being drunk and in
those cases where the defendant had
others dependent upon him for support,
the court has made it a condition on
withholding judgment or suspending
sentence that the defendant take the
pledge for a period varying from six
months to one year. At the close of the
year 101 persons had taken the pledge,
and of this number all but ten had kept
the same faithfully.</p>

<p>In the severe cases where the defendant
was bordering on delirium tremens,
he was committed to the workhouse and
the superintendent informed of his condition.
While there are no special arrangements
for the treatment of inebriates
at the workhouse, Superintendent
O’Connor has successfully provided a
separate department for such cases.
With these inadequate facilities a splendid
work is now being done among this
class of unfortunate and harmless offenders.</p>


<h3><i>Medical and Surgical Treatment.</i></h3>

<p>Men suffering from physical defects
have frequently been before the court
charged with offenses entirely out of
harmony with their antecedents and environments.
In these cases the court
has been able to call to his assistance
some of the best-known surgeons of
the city. During the year three surgical
operations were performed. Two of
these were brain operations and one was
sterilization for degeneracy. Three additional
cases were successfully treated
at private institutions for the drug and
liquor habits.</p>


<h3><i>Separate Trials for Women.</i></h3>

<p>Acting upon the suggestion of Amos
W. Butler and Demarchus C. Brown,
the court set aside Wednesday afternoons
for the separate trials of women
and girls. A woman probation officer
maintains an adequate system of investigation
and supervision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>During the seven months that the
work among women and girls has been
in charge of a probation officer, 139
cases have been investigated, and of that
number only 11 were imprisoned, and
adequate supervision provided for 70
during the probation period.</p>

<p>In 18 cases of drunkenness, under the
supervision of the probation officer,
pledges were taken, and all but three
have kept the same faithfully. In 15
cases of country girls coming to Indianapolis
and falling into bad company,
resulting in their arrest, arrangements
were made, by this officer, for the return
of these girls to their homes in various
parts of the state. In the balance of
these cases investigation disclosed that
the defendants were more sinned against
than sinning and the cases were dismissed.</p>


<h3><i>Restitution.</i></h3>

<p>The criminal code is absolutely silent
upon the question of recovery for loss
or damage to property and injuries to
the person growing out of criminal acts
except that in cases of malicious trespass
the court may fine a defendant a sum
equal to twice the amount of the property
damaged. To fine a person double
the value of the property damaged and
because of his failure to pay the same,
place the additional burden on the citizen
of supporting him in the workhouse
or jail seems in itself an absurdity.</p>

<p>As a part of the probation plan the
court requires every person charged with
any offense involving the loss or damage
to property and injuries to the person
to make full and complete restitution to
the injured party before the final disposition
of the case. Upon a proper
showing that restitution has been made
the court is then in a position to take
such action as the other facts in the
case justify. Under this plan more
than $1,800 in restitution has been recovered
and turned over to the proper
parties.</p>


<h3><i>Results.</i></h3>

<p>The results of the operation of any
system of justice are not to be measured
by dollars and cents.</p>

<p>During the year 1910 the court disposed
of more than 15,000 cases. Notwithstanding
this tremendous volume of
business there was a saving to the county
in the cost of feeding prisoners in the
county jail of $1,393.61 and in the maintenance
of the workhouse, $4,631.95.</p>

<p>Yet the reduction by fifty per cent. of
the number of commitments of persons
to the workhouse, jail and correctional
department of the woman’s prison speaks
with far greater force in favor of the
probation system than any saving in dollars
and cents, for of greater significance
to the community is the moral uplift.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
